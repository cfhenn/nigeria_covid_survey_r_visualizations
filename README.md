# nigeria_covid_survey_r_visualizations
Visualizations of data from the World Bank's LSMS-supported high-frequency phone surveys on COVID-19.

I am new to R and mostly self taught (used to Python/Matlab & C++), so the coding on these is clunky, although I am currently working on improving that.

Data is from https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/lsms/brief/lsms-launches-high-frequency-phone-surveys-on-covid-19
